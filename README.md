### Force a building to produce a unit type

Your Civic Center is not training the unit you want it to?

When trainer is on, you can force a building to produce a type of unit, regardless of trainer settings, by activating vanilla native game feature "auto-queue".

I can play without ever having to use this feature, **see section below for better levreaging of the composition feature**.

### Force a building to idle

The same way you can force a building to train a unit type using auto-queue, you can force it to train _nothing_. Simply activate auto-queue for this building and clear the production queue.

### Configuration for trainer 

For trainer, you have a bunch of options to customize how you will define units to train in game. The goal is for you to be able to change it, to whatever you think is the most intuitive.

Default settings are more intuitive (for most) and faster to manage in game.

_If you have a MouseWheel_ try to desactivate the settings below instead:

Then, use mousewheel on the icon units tab to set desiered composition:
